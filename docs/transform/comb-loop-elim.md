# comb-loop-elim

`comb-loop-elim` detects combinational loops and, when possible, repairs false loops.

The important point is that this pass is now diagnostics-first:

- if it fixes a false loop, it reports that as `info`
- if it finds a loop that it cannot safely resolve, it reports that as `warning`
- it only writes a loop report to the session when you explicitly ask for one

Recent behavior change:

- before this update, resolvable false loops were repaired mainly by generic value splitting
- after this update, the pass first tries a cheaper slice-retarget fast path for loop entrances such as `slice(assign(concat(...)), const)`
- only loops that still remain after retargeting fall back to the generic split-and-rewrite path

## Python Example

```python
with wolvrix.Session() as sess:
    sess.read_sv("top.sv", out_design="design.main")
    diags = sess.run_pass(
        "comb-loop-elim",
        design="design.main",
        out_comb_loop_report="loops.main",
        fix_false_loops=True,
        max_fix_iterations=100,
        fail_on_true_loop=False,
    )
    wolvrix.print_diagnostics(diags, min_level="info")
```

If you omit `out_comb_loop_report`, the pass still returns diagnostics, but it does not silently create a session value.

## What Counts As A Loop

At a high level, the pass:

1. builds a dependency graph over values
2. runs Tarjan SCC detection
3. treats constants, register read ports, latch read ports, and DPI-C calls as boundaries
4. performs a finer-grained bit-range analysis for possible false loops

If the apparent loop is only caused by non-overlapping bit usage, the pass can split values and repair it. That is considered a false loop.

## False-Loop Repair Strategy

The pass now repairs false loops in two stages:

1. retarget loop-entry slices
2. if that is insufficient, split loop values into bit-range fragments and rewrite the affected ops

The first stage is intentionally narrow. It only handles slice-like entrances that can be rewritten without creating a new dependency:

- `kSliceStatic`
- `kSliceDynamic` with a constant index
- retarget through `kAssign`
- retarget through `kConcat`

When the selected slice fully covers a concat operand, the pass can rewrite:

- to `kAssign` if the whole operand is selected
- to `kSliceStatic` if only part of the operand is selected

The pass rejects this rewrite if the chosen new base already depends on the slice result transitively. That guard is important for avoiding pseudo-loop rewrites that would turn a false loop into a real one.

## Carry-Chain Example

This pattern appears in HDLBits `043` after `hier-flatten`:

```text
cout_temp = concat(stage100_cout, ..., stage2_cout, stage1_cout)
stage2_cin = slice(cout_temp, 0)
stage3_cin = slice(cout_temp, 1)
...
stage100_cin = slice(cout_temp, 98)
```

At whole-value granularity this looks cyclic:

```text
cout_temp -> slice -> stageN_cin -> ... -> stageN_cout -> concat -> cout_temp
```

But it is actually a false loop, because each `stageN_cin` only depends on one disjoint bit of `cout_temp`, and that bit comes from the previous stage's `cout`.

## What Actually Changed

The key difference is not "both rewrite the loop". The key difference is **where** the rewrite happens.

- before the fix: rewrite the **whole SCC representation**
- after the fix: rewrite only the **loop entrance slices**

For the same carry-chain false loop, the two strategies look like this.

### Before: Rewrite The Whole SCC

Input shape:

```text
cout_temp = concat(cout_100, ..., cout_2, cout_1)
cin_2 = slice(cout_temp, 0)
cin_3 = slice(cout_temp, 1)
...
```

Old repair strategy:

```text
tmp_cout_temp_bit_0 = cout_1
tmp_cout_temp_bit_1 = cout_2
...
cin_2 = tmp_cout_temp_bit_0
cin_3 = tmp_cout_temp_bit_1
...
cout_temp_full_view = concat(..., tmp_cout_temp_bit_1, tmp_cout_temp_bit_0)
```

That is, the old path created new temporary values for bus fragments, rewired the loop to use those temporaries, and then rebuilt a full-bus view with another `concat` if needed.

So the repair touched:

- the bus being read from
- the bus being written back
- many intermediate values in the SCC
- extra reassembly `concat` ops when a full-value view was still needed

### After: Rewrite Only The Entrances

Input shape:

```text
cout_temp = concat(cout_100, ..., cout_2, cout_1)
cin_2 = slice(cout_temp, 0)
cin_3 = slice(cout_temp, 1)
...
```

New repair strategy:

```text
cout_temp = concat(cout_100, ..., cout_2, cout_1)
cin_2 = cout_1
cin_3 = cout_2
...
```

That is, the pass does **not** first split `cout_temp` into fragments. It directly rewrites each loop-entry slice to the specific concat operand that actually feeds that bit.

So the repair touches only:

- the `slice(cout_temp, const)` entrances

and does **not** rewrite the whole SCC into fragment form.

### Short Version

If the previous wording felt like "the same thing", use this rule of thumb:

- before: "break the bus apart, then rebuild the loop around fragments"
- after: "leave the bus alone, only change `cin_i` from `slice(bus, i)` to the exact source bit producer"

## Concrete Two-Stage Example

Here is the smallest useful example that matches the HDLBits `043` carry-chain shape.

Assume the flattened IR is conceptually:

```text
cout_1 = f(cin)
cin_2 = slice(cout_temp, 0)
cout_2 = f(cin_2)
cout_temp = concat(cout_2, cout_1)
```

### Why This Looks Like A Loop

At whole-value granularity, the dependency graph looks like:

```text
cout_temp -> cin_2 -> cout_2 -> cout_temp
```

So a loop detector that only sees whole values will say:

```text
"there is a loop through cout_temp"
```

### Why It Is Actually A False Loop

The important detail is that `cin_2` does **not** read all of `cout_temp`.
It only reads bit 0:

```text
cout_temp[0] = cout_1
cout_temp[1] = cout_2
cin_2       = cout_temp[0]
```

So in reality:

```text
cin_2 = cout_1
cout_2 = f(cout_1)
```

There is no real combinational self-feedback. The apparent loop only comes from representing the two bits as one whole bus value.

### Before The Fix

The old repair path handled this by fragmenting the whole loop:

```text
tmp_cout_temp_bit_0 = new temporary value for bit 0 of cout_temp
tmp_cout_temp_bit_1 = new temporary value for bit 1 of cout_temp

tmp_cout_temp_bit_0 = cout_1
tmp_cout_temp_bit_1 = cout_2

cin_2 = tmp_cout_temp_bit_0
```

And if some later user still needed the full bus, it could also create:

```text
tmp_cout_temp_full = concat(tmp_cout_temp_bit_1, tmp_cout_temp_bit_0)
```

This is the important part:

- the pass created new temporary values for bus fragments
- then rewired the loop to use those temporaries
- so even though only `cin_2 = slice(cout_temp, 0)` was problematic, the old repair path rewrote the bus representation itself

### After The Fix

The new repair path looks at the same entrance:

```text
cin_2 = slice(cout_temp, 0)
cout_temp = concat(cout_2, cout_1)
```

and directly notices:

```text
bit 0 of cout_temp comes entirely from cout_1
```

So it rewrites only that entrance:

```text
cout_1 = f(cin)
cin_2 = cout_1
cout_2 = f(cin_2)
cout_temp = concat(cout_2, cout_1)
```

No fragmentation of `cout_temp` is needed.

### Why This Matters For `043`

`043` is just this same pattern repeated many times:

```text
cin_2  = previous cout bit
cin_3  = previous cout bit
...
cin_100 = previous cout bit
```

So:

- the old path rewrote a large false-loop SCC into fragment form
- the new path rewrites each entrance directly to the exact previous-stage `cout`

That is why the old behavior reported:

```text
split-values=794 split-ops=7031
```

while the new behavior reports:

```text
retargeted-slices=297 split-values=0 split-ops=0
```

### Behavior Before The Fix

Previously `comb-loop-elim` repaired this kind of loop by generic fragmentation:

- split loop values into many bit-range fragments
- rewrite the carry cone into fragment-level ops
- let later passes try to clean up the expanded IR

That means the pass did not preserve the original carry-chain shape. Instead of keeping:

```text
stage2_cin = slice(cout_temp, 0)
stage3_cin = slice(cout_temp, 1)
...
```

and then simplifying those entrances directly, it first decomposed loop values such as `cout_temp` into many bit-range fragments:

```text
tmp_cout_temp_bit_0 = bit 0 of cout_temp
tmp_cout_temp_bit_1 = bit 1 of cout_temp
...
```

Then it rewrote the loop-related ops so they operated on fragments instead of on the original values:

- `slice` became fragment-to-fragment copies or smaller static slices
- `concat` became fragment assembly ops
- `assign` was duplicated at fragment granularity
- when a full-value view was still needed, the pass created a new `concat` to stitch all fragments back together

For a carry chain like HDLBits `043`, this is much heavier than necessary. The false loop is only at the bus entry points, but the generic split path rewrote a large part of the carry cone as if the entire SCC needed fragment-level normalization.

For DUT `043`, that produced diagnostics like:

```text
split-values=794 split-ops=7031
```

### Behavior After The Fix

Now the pass first rewrites the loop entrances directly:

```text
stage2_cin = stage1_cout
stage3_cin = stage2_cout
...
```

So the false loop is removed without fragmenting the whole carry chain. For the same DUT `043`, the pass now reports:

```text
retargeted-slices=297 split-values=0 split-ops=0
```

In practice this means:

- `comb-loop-elim` no longer causes the main IR blow-up for this pattern
- `simplify` has much less cleanup work afterward
- later passes such as `activity-schedule` start from a much smaller graph

## Session Output

Optional output:

- `out_comb_loop_report`
  - kind `comb-loop.reports`

This is mainly for later inspection or debugging. The primary output of the pass is still diagnostics.

## Key Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-max-analysis-nodes` | `0` | maximum nodes analyzed per graph, `0` means unlimited |
| `-num-threads` | `0` | analysis thread count, `0` uses hardware concurrency |
| `-fix-false-loops` / `-no-fix-false-loops` | true | whether to repair resolvable false loops |
| `-max-fix-iterations` | `100` | maximum repair iterations |
| `-fail-on-true-loop` | false | treat true loops as pass failure |
| `-output-key` | empty | session key for an explicit loop report |

## Diagnostic Raise-Level Interaction

This pass works especially well with the session-level diagnostic raise threshold.

For example:

- with `sess.diagnostics_raise_min_level = "warning"`, any unresolved loop warning becomes an exception
- with `sess.diagnostics_raise_min_level = "error"`, warnings are returned but do not automatically raise

That keeps the pass behavior easy to reason about:

- diagnostics describe what happened
- session raise level decides whether that should stop execution

## Notes

- large designs may need `max_analysis_nodes` tuning
- repairing false loops rewrites the IR
- false-loop repair is no longer synonymous with value splitting; diagnostics may now show `retargeted-slices > 0` with `split-values = 0`
- a true combinational loop usually indicates a real design problem
